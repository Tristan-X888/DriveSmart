# trips/hos.py
"""
HOS planner for property-carrying drivers (70/8 cycle, no adverse conditions).
Rules implemented:
- 70 hours in 8 days (cycle). If exceeded, insert a 34h reset (24h off + next day continues;
  total off-duty across the reset boundary is >=34h).
- Max 11h DRIVING per day.
- Max 14h ON-DUTY window per day (driving + on-duty-not-driving).
- 30 min break required after 8h of DRIVING (fueling can satisfy it as on-duty-not-driving).
- +1h on-duty for pickup (day 1) and +1h for dropoff (final day).
- Fueling every 1,000 miles, modeled as 0.5h on-duty-not-driving each.

Outputs:
logs: [
  {
    "day": 1,
    "segments": [
      {"status": "on_duty_not_driving", "hours": 1.0, "note": "Pickup"},
